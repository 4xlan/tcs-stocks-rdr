Small service for update stock prices, using data from Tinkoff stock exchange.

This is **not**:

- an auto trading bot
- a big interactive client, which can help you to operate with your stocks
- something progressive and unusual

This is:

- Small web service, which just get the prices and help with parcing them by financial programs (lke Skrooge, KMyMoney, etc.)
